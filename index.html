    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <!--As a best practice we should put js code below the
        contents of the body tag b/c since js code is executed in 
        browsers it will create bad user exprience or the browser
        might have a lag processing all those js code before the actual
        page view.

        but to respect the separatiion of concern rule in 
        programming we should store the code inside it in a 
        separate .js file and refernce it here that will be great.
